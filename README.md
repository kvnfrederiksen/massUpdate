User of this app simply needs an Android device 8.0 (Oreo) or higher, and a Bullhorn login.

Once logged in, right click > View Page Source, and scroll to the bottom the get the REST Url and Token required in the first and second
fields, respectively (this is easier to find in S-Release, but the data in Novo is still there). 

This token will remain active for as long as that session of Bullhorn does.

Once done, select the Entity, Field, Option (if applicable), type in your new value, and select whether or not you want the app to add onto
the current value by checking the "Append?" box, and hit "Go!"

You will be notified with a Toast and a special surprise once the app completes the update.
